# What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository is a collection of notes on my computational scientific workflow. It is constantly under refinement as I learn new things or as software tools improve (I am always happy to hear about new efficient ways of working!) The notes may not be relevant to everyone, but might be useful to those who do similar things to me, such as:

* write code in python/matlab/R/Julia
* analyse environmental data (both large and small datasets derived from in situ measurements or simulated numerically)
* use high performance computing (HPC) clusters
* work on unix machines (macOS/linux)

Two important underlying goals of my workflow are that it be well documented, easily repeatable and easily shared. To achieve this I made extensive use of tools such as:

* version control (e.g. git and github.com)
* environments (e.g. conda)
* the shell (e.g. command line interfaces) and shell scripts

Recently, scientific journals have started to require that code and data are archived and accessible prior to publication. I have found that working with tools commonly used for software development streamlines the process of meeting open-access requirements considerably.
