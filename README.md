# What is the purpose of this repository?

This repository is a collection of notes on various aspects of the scientifc workflow and setting up computers. Perhaps more accurately, it describes my own (somewhat aspirational) work flow. As such, the notes may not be relevant to everyone, but might be useful to those who do similar things to me, such as:

* write python/matlab/R/Julia code
* analyse environmental data (both in situ and simulated)
* work via command line interfaces
* use version control and github
* work on unix machines (macOS/linux)
* use high performance computing (HPC) clusters

Importantly, I try to make my workflow well documented and extensively version controlled, which I hope also makes it reproducible. This turns out to be particularly useful when publishing papers, since journals often require that code and data are archived and accesible.
