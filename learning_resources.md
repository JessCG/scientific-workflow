# Online resources

I learned some basic python programming using [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Some of the content is free or accessible for a short time via a free trial. The user interface is extremely intuitive and you can start coding from inside the web browser which is great for beginners. 

[Software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) has open-source lessons on UNIX, R, python, git and more. 

Ryan Abernathey's textbook, [An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro), covers cutting edge python tools for research and data analysis including numpy, matplotlib, pandas, xarray, cartopy and dask. It also introduces a little bit of git and UNIX.

Train your skills in almost any programming language with [Code Wars](https://www.codewars.com/). It is absolutely stuffed with small programming tasks and exercises designed to teach a certain technique. I find you can learn a lot of good tricks by looking at other peoples solutions. 

Train both your mathematical brain and programming knowledge with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). 

## Cheat sheets

Some tools I never use frequently enough to be commit the commands to memory. For those, there are cheat sheets!
